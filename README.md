# Shopping Cart Application

# Dependencies

- Node 4.x (I used v4.0.0, installed via nvm)

# Setup
    npm install
    npm start
    
The application will be running at localhost:3333

# Notes
Not all unit tests have been completed at this stage but have been scoped out. Functional tests have also been scoped out.
Normal development approach I would take is to write the tests first then complete the development. Due to time
constraints not all tests were written before hand.
 
End to end webdriver tests would be written once development was completed to ensure the application had met 
the specifications requested.
